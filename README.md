Open riddles asker

## Why?
I created this software to ask questions from the [Lateral Podcast](https://lateralcast.com) with my friends.

Their license forbids the sharing of the Q&As, so you'll have to find those yourself, either already compiled (they exist) or search throught the episodes transcripts on their website.

This could also be used for any other open ended question riddles, quizzes, ...

## How?
Python (fastapi + uvicorn and sqlalchemy) and mysql backend

Pure HTML, CSS and JS frontend.


Code probably doesn't look great, frankesteined it from my other projects.

## What now?
I don't expect anyone to use this in its current state, but I have some modifications in mind i'll add soonâ„¢.

The biggest reason for this to exist as a repository on my github is to have actions automatically update the instance on my server.
